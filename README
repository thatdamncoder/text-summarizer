**Text Summarizer**
Overview
This project provides a text summarization tool that utilizes the Transformer-based summarizer for condensing lengthy texts into concise summaries. Additionally, it incorporates the YAKE algorithm for keyword extraction and a Naive Bayes classifier for categorizing articles into topics such as business, sports, politics, etc.

Features
Text Summarization: Utilizes Transformer-based summarization techniques to generate summaries of input text.
Keyword Extraction: Implements YAKE algorithm for extracting keywords from text.
Article Classification: Employs a Naive Bayes classifier trained on various topics with an average accuracy of 94% to classify articles.
Recommendation System: Recommends similar articles using the News API.
User Interface: Users can interact with the application through a Streamlit-powered web interface by running home.py.
